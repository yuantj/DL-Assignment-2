\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This assignment is mainly based on the knowledge of Attention Mechanisms and
Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The dataset is generally based on a pedestrian
trajectory recorded in a mall. The models trained in the assignment predict
the positions of the pedestrians. This assignment first trains a GNN model
according to a tutorial, but reimplemented with PyTorch. After training, the
model is evaluated with the main squared error (MSE), the mean Euclidean distance,
and the plot graphs. Next, the model is reexamined by tuning hyperparameters, trying
a deeper embedding, and replacing the learned attention mechanism.
